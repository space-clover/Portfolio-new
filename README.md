## Project Description
My online portfolio is a web application designed to showcase my skills as a web developer and present some of the projects I've worked on. The application is built using modern technologies such as React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio is composed of several sections, including personal information, skills, projects, and contact links.
